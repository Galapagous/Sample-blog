        desc:"In the Holy Quran, it is mentioned that the followers of Islam will eventually divide into different groups or sects, each claiming to follow the true path. This prophecy is reflected in the hadiths where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) foretold that his Ummah (community) would split into seventy-three sects, but only one would be on the right path. This highlights the importance of adhering to the core teachings of Islam and the Quran while recognizing that differences in interpretation and practice are inevitable. Muslims are encouraged to seek knowledge, remain united in their faith, and avoid division to maintain the strength and unity of the Ummah.",

        desc:"George Orwell, through his works, particularly in 1984, teaches the profound importance of holding onto the truth in the face of overwhelming pressure. He illustrates how truth can be manipulated and how societies can be led astray when individuals forsake their commitment to reality. Orwell's message is a powerful reminder that abandoning the truth not only erodes personal integrity but also paves the way for tyranny and oppression. Upholding the truth, even when it is difficult, is essential for maintaining freedom and justice in any society",
